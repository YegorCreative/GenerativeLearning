                <p>Discover how psychological safety, constructive 
                    conflict, and actionable learning create a powerful
                    triple helix to transform teams!<br>
                    <br>In this ground-breaking resource, three experts in 
                    the field of education and teamwork each present

                    interactions into a transformative way of working. 
                    You’ll learn approaches, processes and tools to 
                    overcome common obstacles to team effectiveness 
                    such as feelings of futility, anxiety, and poor morale.<br> 
                    <br>Drawing on research and practical experience the

                    <h3>Book Review</h3>
                    <p>Transforming Teamwork is an intelligent and artfully crafted resource that provides deep insights into team learning. If you study this book as a team, not only will your team transform, your lives will be forever changed. It gets to the core of what it means to be human in relationship with others. Informed by current research from neuroscience, social science, and behavioral and cognitive psychology, Zimmerman, Roussin and Garmston challenge old assumptions, reveal new paradigms, and ultimately bring us to new collaborative actions that have the power to transform organizational cultures and even entire communities.

                    <p>The definitive guide to implementing change from 
                        the experts who designed CBAM!<br>
                        The Concerns-Based Adoption Model (CBAM) is one
                        of the most robust and empirically grounded 
                        frameworks for implementing educational change 
                        ever created. Now you can learn how to use CBAM 
                        to drive successful school improvement from the
                         experts who created it more than 20 years ago, 
                        Shirley Hord and Gene Hall! The authors share six 
                        strategies for ensuring successful educational 
                        change:<br>
                        <br>• Create a shared vision of the change
                        <br>• Plan and identify resources necessary for the
                        change
                        <br>• Invest in professional development
                        <br>• Check or assess progress
                        <br>• Provide assistance
                        <br>• Create a context conducive to change

                    <h3>Book Review</h3>
                    <p>Few ideas in education are more fundamental to our understanding of the change process than those described in this book.  The Stages of Concern addressing individual’s feelings and perceptions, the Levels of Use describing the gradual development of expertise, and Innovation Configurations that consider the fidelity of innovation implementation, provide the basis for nearly all models of change.  Shirley and Jim, who have been a part of this crucial work from the very beginning, present these fundamental elements in a modern context and show how they are just as relevant today as they were when developed nearly four decades ago.  It is a “Must Read” for every educational leader who wants to successfully navigate the difficult and complex process of change.</p>

                    <h3>About “Guiding Professional Learning Communities”</h3>
                    <p>This research-based sequel to Leading Professional 
                        Learning Communities focuses on the practical 
                        process of implementing, improving, and sustaining 
                        PLCs. Appropriate for groups at all stages of PLC 
                        development, this field book helps educators 
                        improve PLC operations by facilitating individual 
                        and group development and growth. The authors 
                        provide learning opportunities that generate 
                        conversations about adult learning and contribute
                        to supportive conditions that strengthen teacher 
                        quality and raise student outcomes.

                    <h3>Book Review</h3>
                    <p>One weekend morning, I sat down with my cup
                        of coffee to read a book, and much to my delight, two hours later, I had not read a book, but rather mapped out a learning plan for an entire year. The best gift of all, everything I will need is right here in this book. When you sit down to read this book, make sure you have a calendar at your side. Get ready to go on a shopping spree of ideas; like all good shoppers choose wisely, for there is no way you can possibly use all of the ideas in this book in one year. I assure you, you will not have buyer’s remorse!"</p>
