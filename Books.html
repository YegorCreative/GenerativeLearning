                    conflict, and actionable learning create a powerful
                    triple helix to transform teams!<br>
                    <br>In this ground-breaking resource, three experts in 
                    the field of education and teamwork each present

                    <h3>Book Review</h3>
                    <p>Transforming Teamwork is an intelligent and artfully crafted resource that provides deep insights into team learning. If you study this book as a team, not only will your team transform, your lives will be forever changed. It gets to the core of what it means to be human in relationship with others. Informed by current research from neuroscience, social science, and behavioral and cognitive psychology, Zimmerman, Roussin and Garmston challenge old assumptions, reveal new paradigms, and ultimately bring us to new collaborative actions that have the power to transform organizational cultures and even entire communities.

                <h3>About “Implementing Change Through Learning”</h3>
                <p>The definitive guide to implementing change from 
                    the experts who designed CBAM!<br>
                    The Concerns-Based Adoption Model (CBAM) is one
                    of the most robust and empirically grounded 
                    frameworks for implementing educational change 
                    ever created. Now you can learn how to use CBAM 
                    to drive successful school improvement from the
                     experts who created it more than 20 years ago, 
                    Shirley Hord and Gene Hall! The authors share six 
                    strategies for ensuring successful educational 
                    change:<br>
                    <br>• Create a shared vision of the change
                    <br>• Plan and identify resources necessary for the
                    change
                    <br>• Invest in professional development
                    <br>• Check or assess progress
                    <br>• Provide assistance
                    <br>• Create a context conducive to change
                    </p>
                    <h3>Book Review</h3>
                    <p>Few ideas in education are more fundamental to our understanding of the change process than those described in this book.  The Stages of Concern addressing individual’s feelings and perceptions, the Levels of Use describing the gradual development of expertise, and Innovation Configurations that consider the fidelity of innovation implementation, provide the basis for nearly all models of change.  Shirley and Jim, who have been a part of this crucial work from the very beginning, present these fundamental elements in a modern context and show how they are just as relevant today as they were when developed nearly four decades ago.  It is a “Must Read” for every educational leader who wants to successfully navigate the difficult and complex process of change.</p>

                <p>This research-based sequel to Leading Professional 
                    Learning Communities focuses on the practical 
                    process of implementing, improving, and sustaining 
                    PLCs. Appropriate for groups at all stages of PLC 
                    development, this field book helps educators 
                    improve PLC operations by facilitating individual 
                    and group development and growth. The authors 
                    provide learning opportunities that generate 
                    conversations about adult learning and contribute
                    to supportive conditions that strengthen teacher 
                    quality and raise student outcomes.

                    <h3>Book Review</h3>
                    <p>One weekend morning, I sat down with my cup
                        of coffee to read a book, and much to my delight, two hours later, I had not read a book, but rather mapped out a learning plan for an entire year. The best gift of all, everything I will need is right here in this book. When you sit down to read this book, make sure you have a calendar at your side. Get ready to go on a shopping spree of ideas; like all good shoppers choose wisely, for there is no way you can possibly use all of the ideas in this book in one year. I assure you, you will not have buyer’s remorse!"</p>
